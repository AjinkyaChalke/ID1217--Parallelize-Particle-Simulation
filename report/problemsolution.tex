    \subsection{Simulation Design}

        Each frame the original implementation made $n^2$ computations, for each
        particle it calculated the distance of each other particle, it the
        particle was close enough it also calculated the real effect, and
        applied the appropriate force to the particle. 

        \begin{equation}
            gridSize = \frac{\sqrt{0.0005 \cdot n}}{0.01} + 1 \\
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            grid.size = gridSize^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{0.0005 \cdot n}}{0.01} + 1\right)^2
        \end{equation}
