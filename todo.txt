'A plot in log-log scale that shows that your serial and parallel codes run in O(n) time and a description of the data structures that you used to achieve it. In order to get more precise timing estimates, we recommend you to run a program at least 5 times and take the median (rather than the mean) of the simulation times.' (...report/report.tex:70)
